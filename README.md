## OOP Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects: Each bank account is represented as an object with attributes like account number, balance, etc.
- Encapsulation: Private data members ensure that account details are accessed only through public methods.
- File Handling: Transaction details are stored in files to ensure persistence across sessions (if applicable).
- Inheritance: Extensions of the base account class for specific account types
